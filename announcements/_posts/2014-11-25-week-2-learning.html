<h1>Week 2 - Learning by doing together!</h1>

<p>Hey</p>

<p>Last week we talked about community. We could probably have a complete course on that and call it “Community in a Box”. Someone may be doing just <a href="http://community.p2pu.org/t/please-introduce-yourself/28/114">that</a>!</p>

<p>If you missed last week, don’t worry, you can join the conversation on <a href="http://community.p2pu.org/t/course-in-a-box-community-safari/1153">discourse</a> and continue working on the projects at your own pace.</p>

<p>This week we are discussing learning design. We have several projects to help us learn:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/learning/projects/">Look how other courses do it</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/learning/projects/">Plan your learning outcomes</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/learning/projects/">Add modules to your course in GitHub</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since this week is not a fully fledged week for everyone around the world, we are considering rescheduling the hangout. Please indicate your preference on the <a href="http://doodle.com/acgcyxqzhb8staeq">doodle poll</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers
The P2PU Team</p>
